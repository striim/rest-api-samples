# Guide to Constributing

## Coding guidelines

1. Existing code in the repo follows a folder-structure convention. Follow similar convention when contributing new samples.
2. Use build tools that are popular with the language.
3. There must be a unit test backing the sample. Unit tests must run against a live server running in `localhost:9080` with username-password combination of `admin` / `admin`.
4. Ensure the code formatting and indentation follow the industry standard for that language.

## Code contribution

1. Fork the repo and send a pull request.
